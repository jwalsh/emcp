# Conjectures

Status tracking for the open conjectures. Each requires a
measurement note: confirmed, refuted, or indeterminate with data.

Detailed research in `docs/conjectures/c-NNN-research.md`.

| ID | Claim | Status | Evidence |
|----|-------|--------|----------|
| C-001 | Claude Code uses on-demand tool indexing | Confirmed (refined) | 2026-03-18: Protocol-level measurement confirms two-tier architecture. MCP layer is eager (all 780 tools in one 263KB response, no pagination). Claude Code application layer is lazy: tool names listed as `<available-deferred-tools>`, full schemas fetched on demand via `ToolSearch`. See `docs/conjectures/c-001-research.md` |
| C-002 | Arglist heuristic yields > 80% precision | Refuted | 2026-03-18: 50-function audit yields 40% precision (20 TP, 30 FP). `object`/`buffer` arg patterns dominate false positives. See `docs/c002-audit.md` |
| C-003 | emacsclient round-trip < 50ms for string fns | Confirmed | 2026-03-18: median=2.3ms, P95=~3ms, worst=24ms (GC jitter). 200 samples, 0% above 50ms. Prior 10.9ms was inflated by measurement script overhead |
| C-004 | Non-ASCII survives full round trip | Confirmed | 2026-03-18: 14 character classes tested (CJK, emoji, ZWJ families, Arabic, Thai, Korean, combining, supplementary plane, flags). All byte-identical round trips via hex comparison |
| C-005 | Maximalist manifest causes measurable init latency vs core | Confirmed | 2026-03-18: core=0.1ms (60 tools), 780 tools=1.7ms, 3.6k extrapolated=~10ms. Token cost is the real impact: core ~5.7k tokens vs maximalist ~341k tokens |
| C-006 | Vanilla Emacs exposes substantially fewer functions than configured | Confirmed | 2026-03-18: vanilla (-Q) = 8460, configured (init.el) = 10040. Delta = 1580 (18.7%). Same C primitives (1336); difference is Elisp-defined functions |
| C-008 | Pure Elisp MCP server can fully replace the Python shim | Confirmed (prototype) | 2026-03-18: `src/emcp-stdio.el` implements full MCP JSON-RPC over stdio in ~250 lines. `emacs --batch -Q` produces 779 tools + 9 daemon data layer tools. Passes initialize, tools/list, tools/call. Unicode round-trip confirmed. Eliminates Python stack entirely. See `docs/conjectures/c-008-research.md` |

## Measurement Details

### C-001: On-demand tool indexing (Confirmed, refined 2026-03-18)

**2026-03-18 protocol-level measurement** (supersedes prior observations):

The MCP protocol supports pagination (`tools/list` uses
`PaginatedRequest`/`PaginatedResult` with `cursor`/`nextCursor`) but
this server does not implement it. All tools are returned in one response:

| Manifest | Tool count | tools/list response | Latency | Est. tokens |
|----------|------------|---------------------|---------|-------------|
| Core | 60 | 21 KB | 1.7ms | ~5,263 |
| Maximalist | 780 | 263 KB | 8.2ms | ~67,264 |
| Synthetic | 3,600 | 1.2 MB | 60.1ms | ~315,356 |

All responses had `nextCursor=None`. The MCP client receives the
full tool list eagerly.

**Two-tier indexing confirmed via self-observation**: Claude Code (Opus
4.6) operates with 840 MCP tools (60 core + 780 maximalist) in this
session. Tools appear as `<available-deferred-tools>` (names only) in
the system prompt. Full JSON schemas are fetched on demand via
`ToolSearch`. The LLM context never contains all 263 KB of tool schemas.

Architecture: MCP layer = eager (full dump), application layer = lazy
(names in prompt, schemas on demand).

Prior evidence: original session (2026-02-04, ~3169 tools), re-verified
2026-03-17 (4324 tools).

### C-003: emacsclient latency (Confirmed)

**2026-03-18 update** (supersedes prior measurement):
- Median: 2.3ms, P95: ~3ms, worst outlier: 24ms (GC/TCP jitter)
- 200 samples across 10 expressions, 0% above 50ms threshold
- Prior data showing "10.9ms" was inflated by measurement script overhead
  (historical -- Python stack removed)
- Daemon connected via TCP (0.0.0.0); Unix socket would be faster

Prior measurement (2026-03-17): `(+ 1 1)` = 10.9ms, `(string-trim " hello ")` < 15ms.

### C-004: Non-ASCII round trip (Confirmed)

**2026-03-18 update** (expanded from 6 to 14 character classes):
- 14 character classes tested: CJK, emoji, ZWJ families
  (e.g. family emoji), Arabic, Thai, Korean, combining characters,
  supplementary plane (musical symbols), flag emoji
- All byte-identical round trips confirmed via hex comparison
- Transformation tests pass: upcase/downcase preserve diacritics,
  string-trim works on CJK, reverse works on Japanese
- The escape layer (historical -- now replaced by `prin1-to-string` /
  `format "%S"` in the Elisp server) only touched ASCII chars;
  all non-ASCII passes through as raw UTF-8

Prior measurement (2026-03-17): 6/6 live tests pass (CJK, emoji, combining).

### C-005: Init latency differential (Confirmed)

**2026-03-18 update** (refined measurements):
- Init latency: 0.1ms (core/60 tools) vs 1.7ms (780 tools) vs ~10ms
  (3.6k tools, extrapolated)
- Ratio: 16.8x (780 vs 60), ~92x (3600 vs 60)
- Token cost is the real impact: core ~5.7k tokens, maximalist 3.6k
  tools ~341k tokens (~1.3MB JSON)
- Wall-clock init difference is not user-perceptible; token budget
  impact validates the reductio ad absurdum thesis

Prior measurement (2026-03-17): core=0.7ms (69 tools), maximalist=15.9ms (4324 tools), ~23x ratio.

### C-002: Arglist heuristic precision (Refuted)

**2026-03-18 measurement**: 50-function random sample (seed=42) from
the manifest (historical `functions-compact.jsonl`), manually classified.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| True Positives | 20 |
| False Positives | 30 |
| Precision | 40% |
| Conjectured threshold | 80% |

The heuristic matches argument names against
`string|str|text|buffer|object|obj|seq|sequence`. The dominant false
positive sources:

- **`object`/`obj` args** (12 FPs): catches every type predicate
  (`bignump`, `compiled-function-p`, etc.) and EIEIO OOP methods
- **`buffer`/`buffers` args** (10 FPs): catches `display-buffer-*`
  window management, process functions, variable-scope predicates
- **`string` in compound arg names** (5 FPs): catches completion
  internals (`format-string`, etc.) and server IPC

Notable false negatives (useful text functions missed):
- Zero-arg functions: `buffer-string`, `point-min`, `point-max`
- Non-matching arg names: `char-to-string` (arg: `char`),
  `number-to-string` (arg: `number`), `file-name-extension` (arg:
  `filename`), `insert` (arg: `args`)

The `sequence`/`seq` pattern performs best (~80% TP rate in the sample).

Full audit: `docs/c002-audit.md`.

### C-006: Vanilla vs configured function count (Confirmed)

**2026-03-18 measurement** on GNU Emacs 30.2 (aarch64-apple-darwin24.6.0):

| Metric | Vanilla (`-Q`) | Configured (init.el) | Delta |
|--------|---------------|----------------------|-------|
| Total `fboundp` symbols | 8460 | 10040 | +1580 (+18.7%) |
| C primitives (`subrp`) | 1336 | 1336 | 0 |
| Elisp-defined (non-subr) | 7383 | 8704 | +1321 |
| Autoloaded | 2846 | 2518 | -328 |
| Interactive commands | 3011 | 3087 | +76 |
| Total obarray symbols | 17398 | 22449 | +5051 (+29%) |
| Loaded features | 107 | 152 | +45 |
| Loaded files | 127 | 172 | +45 |

Key findings:
- C primitives are identical: init.el does not change the compiled core
- The configured daemon adds ~1580 functions (18.7% increase), all Elisp
- Autoloads *decrease* in the configured daemon because some get resolved
  (loaded) during init, converting from autoload stubs to real definitions
- The delta of +1321 Elisp-defined functions comes from the 45 additional
  files/features loaded by init.el
- Interactive commands barely change (+76), suggesting init.el mainly
  adds library functions, not user commands
- Total obarray grows 29% (5051 additional symbols: variables, faces, etc.)
- A third measurement (--no-init-file, with site-lisp) showed identical
  counts to -Q, confirming that site-lisp adds nothing on this system

Implications for the project:
- The anti-goal "config-dependent wrapper" is validated: the function
  count difference (18.7%) is meaningful but not transformative
- A vanilla daemon exposes 8460 functions, of which the arglist heuristic
  would filter to the manifest subset. The core tool set is stable
  regardless of user configuration
- The 780-line manifest (current) represents ~9.2% of vanilla functions
  and ~7.8% of configured functions

### C-008: Pure Elisp MCP server replaces Python shim (Confirmed, prototype 2026-03-18)

**Claim**: The Python MCP shim can be fully replaced by a pure Elisp MCP
server running in batch mode, with no loss of protocol compliance or
functionality.

**2026-03-18 measurement**:

`src/emcp-stdio.el` implements a complete MCP JSON-RPC 2.0 server over
stdio in approximately 250 lines of Emacs Lisp.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Implementation size | ~250 lines Elisp |
| Tool count (vanilla `-Q`) | 779 |
| Daemon data layer tools | 9 (when daemon detected) |
| Total tools (with daemon) | 788 |
| Protocol methods passing | `initialize`, `tools/list`, `tools/call` |
| Unicode round-trip | Confirmed (NAIVE RESUME CAFE with diacritics, emoji) |

**Invocation**: `emacs --batch -Q -l src/emcp-stdio.el -f emcp-stdio-start`

**What it eliminates**: the entire Python stack — `server.py`, `escape.py`,
`dispatch.py`, `uv`, the `mcp` Python SDK, and the manifest build artifact
(`functions-compact.jsonl`). Introspection happens live at startup via
`mapatoms`, not from a pre-built JSONL file.

**What remains**: `emacsclient` is still used for daemon data layer tools
(buffer listing, file operations on the running daemon), but local
function tools (string manipulation, type predicates, etc.) execute
directly in the batch Emacs process with no IPC.

**Gotchas found**:
- `json-serialize` returns unibyte UTF-8 strings in batch mode; requires
  `decode-coding-string` before `princ` to avoid mojibake on stdout
- `emacsclient` TCP connections emit diagnostic lines that must be
  filtered before parsing — same issue as `dispatch.py` already handles

**Architectural implications**:
- The foundational axiom ("Emacs tells the server what it can do") is
  strengthened: the server IS Emacs, so introspection locality is trivially
  satisfied
- The manifest format invariant becomes unnecessary — there is no manifest;
  tools are registered directly from `obarray` at startup
- The security boundary shifts from `escape.py` (Python string escaping)
  to Elisp's own `read`/`prin1-to-string` round-trip
- Build order simplifies: no L2 (manifest) or L3 (escape) layers needed

Full analysis: `docs/conjectures/c-008-research.md`.

## Instrumentation Hooks

(Historical -- Python stack removed; see C-008 for the pure Elisp replacement.)

- **C-001, C-005**: Measured via `emacs --batch -Q -l src/emcp-stdio.el` with
  JSON-RPC requests; tool count and init timing from `tools/list` response
- **C-003**: `emacsclient --eval` timing via shell scripts
- **C-004**: `tests/test_emcp_stdio_integration.sh` Unicode test suite (U-01
  through U-04)
- **C-002**: Random sampling from `functions-compact.jsonl` (manual audit,
  see `docs/c002-audit.md`)
- **C-006**: `emacsclient --eval` with `mapatoms`/`fboundp` counting against
  daemons started with `-Q` vs normal init
- **C-008**: `emacs --batch -Q -l src/emcp-stdio.el -f emcp-stdio-start` with
  JSON-RPC requests piped to stdin; tool count from `tools/list`, Unicode
  correctness via `tools/call` with non-ASCII arguments

## Extended Conjectures (2026-03-19)

The following 34 conjectures are introduced by four new specs in
`docs/specs/`. They extend the C-001 through C-011 series with
daemon-as-retrieval-layer (C-D), eval trust boundary (C-E), agent
presence/discovery (C-F), and observability (C-G) concerns.

### Measurement Protocol Notes

- **C-D series**: Validated by loading `emcp-query-library.el` into a running
  daemon and calling each function via `emcp-data-eval`. Comparison baseline
  for C-D002 is sqlite-vec with nomic-embed-text on nexus.
- **C-E series**: Validated by multi-host testing on the homelab. C-E001 and
  C-E009 can be tested on a single machine with synthetic eval calls. C-E008
  is a red-team exercise.
- **C-F series**: Requires at least two hosts with Avahi and mDNS configured.
  C-F004 and C-F009 can be tested locally with `avahi-publish`/`avahi-browse`.
- **C-G series**: Requires the Docker Grafana stack running. C-G002 can be
  tested by stopping/starting the daemon and timing the metric change.
