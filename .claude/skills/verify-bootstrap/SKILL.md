# Verify Bootstrap

This skill is inherently idempotent — it reads files and reports findings.
Running it multiple times is expected and safe.

## Prerequisite Check

Before verifying, confirm the minimum scaffold exists:

- `CLAUDE.md` must exist. If not: stop with "run `/generate-claude-md` first."
- `spec.org` must exist. If not: stop with "no spec.org found."

If both exist, proceed with verification.

## Verification Questions

Read CLAUDE.md, spec.org, and memory files, then answer:

1. **What is this project?**
   Expected: MCP server exposing Emacs obarray functions as tools
   via runtime introspection.

2. **Who is the primary user?**
   Expected: Agentic runtimes (Claude Code / MCP clients).

3. **What is the primary output artifact?**
   Expected: A running MCP server over stdio with two modes (core/maximalist).

4. **What is the first build step?**
   Expected: escape.py — pytest tests/test_escape.py passes all cases.

5. **How many open conjectures?**
   Expected: 5 (C-001 through C-005).

## Process

1. Read CLAUDE.md and extract answers
2. Cross-reference with spec.org
3. Report each answer with pass/fail
4. If any fail, identify the gap in CLAUDE.md or memory and report
   what needs to be fixed

## Success Criteria

All 5 answers must be derivable from CLAUDE.md alone (without reading
spec.org). If any require spec.org to answer, CLAUDE.md is incomplete.
